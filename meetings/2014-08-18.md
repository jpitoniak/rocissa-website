## Special Presentation: Integration around a SIEM: Avoiding security silos

While SIEM solutions can be deployed to harness security-relevant information from across your organization, they can introduce a number of challenges as well.  Without careful thought, SIEM solutions can lead to silos created by a non-integrated, point solution-based approach to IT security. Jose will discuss best practices around integration, monitoring, and maintenance.

In addition, he will discuss how to dissolve information silos and help you gain a stronger, more cohesive IT security environment.

### Jose Bravo, IBM Tiger Team member

Jose Bravo has worked for the last eight years as a subject matter expert in IBM Security, joining the elite Security Tiger Team in 2013
(one of only 8 members in the US). He has assisted IBM partners with opportunity identification, vision creation, white board security sessions, technical issues/positioning, competition, pricing, live demos, and negotiating recommendations. In addition, he has posted more than one hundred short videos that IBM partners have forwarded to their customers (more than 60,000 views so far). Jose's main area of expertise is strong authentication where he has been granted one patent and has filed six others (Second Plateau). Before joining IBM 27 years ago, he worked in the areas of design and field-testing of digital hardware, and
later in software development for telecommunication equipment in Venezuela.

Jose Bravo received his BS in Electronic Engineering from Simon Bolivar University (Caracas, Venezuela) and a Master of Science in Computer and Systems Engineering from RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy New York).
