## Special Presentation: Defense Against an Evolving Threat Landscape-War Stories From the Trenches

A new breed of carefully orchestrated, multi-vector assaults are overwhelming the security infrastructure – and overpowering typical network security measures – of enterprises worldwide. Traditional countermeasures have failed and will continue to fail in future incidents.
