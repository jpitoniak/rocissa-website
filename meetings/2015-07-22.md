Please Join the Rochester ISSA and **Grey Castle Security** for a fun filled evening of networking and information security.

The focus of the night will be a game of “Cyber I SPY”.

This activity has been designed by GreyCastle Security to test your personal awareness of your surroundings. You will be tasked with spotting things that are out of the ordinary. There will be score cards and a prize will be awarded to the winner. This activity will culminate with a commentary by Reg Harnish, CEO of GreyCastle.
