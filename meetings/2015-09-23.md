## Special Presentation: Modern Threats Require Modern Defenses: 3 Security Concepts for 2016

As our cyber defenses continue to be less than sufficient, we are realizing we must tailor them more to the attacks that face us.  While the problem isn’t necessarily in the security technology stack itself, the overall strategy of your the stack, the team, and overall resource utilization must be revisited.  We’ll explore three advanced cyber defense concepts that you should be applying or at least considering as we head into 2016: analytics, orchestration, and risk hunting.
