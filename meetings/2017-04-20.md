## Special Presentation: Dissecting the OPM Breach

The 2015 data breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was a defining moment for the federal government, as it continues to reel from the colossal theft of personnel information affecting 21.5 million individuals. Chris was onsite and helped discover and subsequently work the remediation of the OPM breach. He was literally in the trenches as it unfolded. Join us for an insightful discussion to understand more about this massive cyberattack.
