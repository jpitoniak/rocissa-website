## Special Presentation: Adapting to Fight Back: How Cyber AI Neutralizes Never-Before-Seen Threats

In a world that is increasingly digital, cyber-attacks have become the most significant risk confronting todayâ€™s businesses, smart cities, and critical infrastructure. Online crime cost the world more than half a trillion dollars last year, while recent attacks have managed to influence the U.S. presidential election and disrupt the Ukrainian power supply. This troubling state of affairs is the product of several fundamental weaknesses with the traditional approach to cyber defense, which relies on predefining what threats look like at a time when criminals launch never-before-seen attacks on a daily basis. Moreover, these attacks increasingly strike at machine-speed, preventing security professionals from responding before their damage is done.
