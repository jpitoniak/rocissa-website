   Security teams are already overtaxed, and security budgets insufficient to cover existing risk.  Now management is asking:  what about AI?  Governance is key, but finding a starting point can be daunting.  The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is a useful tool to develop AI risk management and governance, but--as is the case with any tool--proper implementation is key.  This discussion will introduce the NIST AI RMF and discuss how to operationalize its primary functions, and align them with existing security approaches, like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  It will identify key areas of convergence, like the need for a global, enterprise risk assessment, as well as the unique dangers of AI implementation, like the proliferation of shadow AI; lurking privacy concerns; and data ownership.
